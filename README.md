# MoneyDSL 💰  
A C++20 domain-specific library for **precise money arithmetic** using fixed-point representation.  
Avoid floating-point rounding errors and ensure safe currency operations at compile time.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔒 **Type-safe currencies** (e.g., USD, EUR) — prevents mixing different currency types accidentally  
- ⚡ **Fixed-point arithmetic** — stores money as scaled integers, preserving decimal accuracy  
- ➕ Overloaded operators for clean and natural syntax  
- 🔁 **Conversion support** — compile-time checked conversions between currencies  
- ✅ Unit tests with GoogleTest  

---

## To Do
- **Further improve floating point accuracy**
- **Extend DSL to support more currencies and use recent conversion rates**
- **Add more functionality**
