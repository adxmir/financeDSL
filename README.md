# MoneyDSL 
A C++20 domain-specific library for **precise money arithmetic** using fixed-point representation.  
Avoid floating-point rounding errors and ensure safe currency operations at compile time.  

---

## Features
- **Type-safe currencies** (e.g., USD, EUR) — prevents mixing different currency types accidentally  
- **Fixed-point arithmetic** — stores money as scaled integers, preserving decimal accuracy  
- Overloaded operators for clean and natural syntax  
- **Conversion support** — compile-time checked direct and indirect conversions between currencies  
- Unit tests with GoogleTest  

---

## To Do
- **Further improve floating point accuracy**
- **Extend DSL to utilise upto date conversion rates**
- **Increase DSL functionality**
